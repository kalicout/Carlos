## So now you need:

    A local editor: to create, edit, and manage Markdown notes.

    Folder-based structure: like Obsidian vaults (simple folders and .md files).

    Git integration: track, push, and publish selected notes.

    Custom app: lightweight, efficient, secure.

Then, here’s the updated tech stack I strongly recommend:

## Part Recommendation

Language Rust (security, speed, memory safe)
GUI Framework Tauri (very light, uses system WebView)
Text Editing (Markdown) Build a simple editor, or embed a markdown editor (like codemirror, if you use webview inside Tauri)
Git Handling git2-rs Rust library (libgit2 bindings)
Markdown Parser pulldown-cmark (safe, efficient in Rust)
Local Storage Native filesystem (folders and files) — like Obsidian
Server Side Rust + Actix-Web server + Gitea OR your own Git backend
Authentication Public-Key Auth / JWTs
Why this?

    Rust gives you both a safe client and server (same language for both sides).

    Tauri is insanely lightweight: app builds are ~5–10 MB instead of Electron's 150 MB.

    git2-rs lets you integrate Git tightly: you can commit, push, pull directly from the app.

    Markdown + filesystem means users always control their notes locally (no databases needed).

    Security first: Rust’s ownership system eliminates most memory bugs.

    High efficiency: both memory and CPU usage will be minimal compared to heavy frameworks.

## Minimum Features your app would need:

    Create/edit/delete Markdown notes locally.

    Organize notes into folders/tags.

    Select which notes to "publish" (commit and push).

    Git status and history visualization.

    Push notes to a remote Git server (you can manage this server).

    (Optionally) Markdown preview inside the app.

## Nice-to-haves for researchers later:

    Link notes together ([[wikilinks]] style).

    Tagging system.

    Search across notes.

    Encryption for sensitive notes before publishing.

    Simple version history inside the app.

    Notifications when a Git push succeeds or fails.

Visual: How this would flow:

[Your App]
↓
(Notes written as markdown files locally)
↓
(Git Commit inside app)
↓
(Git Push to Server)
↓
(Server hosts open investigation, readable by others)

TL;DR (updated)

✅ Build your own lightweight Obsidian-style editor with Markdown + filesystem + Git integration, using Rust + Tauri for the client, Rust + Actix-Web or Gitea for the server.

✅ Full control, memory safe, super efficient, security-first design.

# 🛠️ Dependencies you probably will need (in Cargo.toml)

[dependencies]
tauri = { version = "2", features = ["api-all"] }
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
git2 = "0.18" # Libgit2 bindings
pulldown-cmark = "0.9" # Markdown parsing
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] } # Async tasks
anyhow = "1.0" # Error handling
thiserror = "1.0" # Error enums
dirs = "5.0" # Find OS paths easily

# 🧠 Important design notes:

    Separate concerns:
    Don’t mix Git logic inside notes manager → each module has its responsibility.

    Shared State:
    Use Tauri’s State feature to share app-wide info safely (vault path, login info).

    Security:
    Be careful with Tauri API permissions (e.g., restrict file access only to the user’s vault).

    Offline-first:
    Always work on local .md files, and push to server manually when user wants.

    Version Control:
    Every note is saved by Git commit, so even accidental edits can be rolled back.
